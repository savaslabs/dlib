      "text": "The history of Durham, North Carolina, though not long, is rich, and no aspect of it is richer than that of its African-American community. Durham has many stories to tell: the neighborhood that was Hayti, the businesses on Parrish Street (\"Black Wall Street\"), Durham blues, the first African-American female Episcopal priest, and the first black-owned insurance company in the U.S. Each of these, as well as many more, make up the complex history of the Bull City.

      "text": "The Durham Civil Rights Heritage Project focuses on one set of those storiesâ€”those about the Civil Rights Movement in Durham. The project's main focus was to collect photographs depicting the movement in Durham. Oral histories of Durham's civil rights era were also gathered. These stories and images only begin to depict the events that happened here and the changes that came about because of them."

      "text": "The project officially began in May 2003, and community collection days were planned for various sites around Durham. The project sponsored three collection days: one at the Durham County Library, one at the Hayti Heritage Center, and one at St. Joseph's AME Church. Sixteen oral histories were recorded and nearly 125 photographs were collected from both private individuals and professional photographers. "

      "text": "The DCRHP used the materials gathered to create a public art project of 11, 6' tall banners hung in artful handcrafted frames. The banners incorporated photographs, quotes from interviews with local people, and text to depict some of the history of the Civil Rights Movement in Durham. The banners traveled to schools, malls, libraries, storefronts, and other locations for over 10 years and now reside in the Stanford L. Warren Library, a branch of the Durham County Library on Fayetteville street."

In 2020, the North Carolina Collection at Durham County Library was approached by Savas Labs about re-designing the online exhibit. Additional content was added to reflect the continuing movement for civil rights in Durham and the United States.  "
