After more than a year, feeling their negotiations were leading nowhere, about 50 members of the Afro-American Society, along with a few former students, occupied the Allen Administration Building just after its offices opened on February 13, 1969."

Caught completely by surprise, administrators met through the afternoon; so did student and faculty groups. Just after 5 p.m., Durham mayor Wense Grabarek notified the Duke administration that 240 National Guardsmen had been mobilized in case they were needed. Meantime, a contingent of Durham police prepared to move into the building, even as the students, after talking with administrators and local activists, were preparing to move out."

More students poured out of their dormitories, and for an hour police and students charged at and retreated from each other. Twenty students were later treated for injuries sustained during the melee, and police made five arrests. In protest, the black students created Malcolm X University. Many of the white students boycotted classes for three days."

        "text": "After subsequent talks, the university agreed to act on some of the students' demands, including establishing a program in Afro-American studies. In March, the university brought 13 \"ringleaders\" of the occupation to an on-campus hearing under Duke's \"Pickets and Protest\" policy. The other 48 involved in the occupation appeared at the hearing in support of their leaders. All defendants were allowed to remain in school but were given one year of probation."

Well known for his symbolic stand \"in the schoolhouse doorway\" to oppose integration at the University of Alabama, he entered the presidential race claiming to offer voters \"a real choice,\" and that there was \"not a dime's worth of difference\" between the two major parties. Arriving at the Raleigh-Durham Airport on October 24, Wallace said, \"Both national parties can't understand a redneck running for president. They have looked down their noses at us.\""

Spectators came from as far away as Onslow and Haywood counties. Wallace delivered a speech similar to others he had given around the country. He pledged to \"return some sanity\" to the federal government, criticized \"federal guideline writers,\" and claimed to have the support of Southern union leadersâ€”though the national AFL-CIO was attempting to discredit his claim to be a friend to organized labor."
